                <li>Fresh <q>fruits</q> are a great option for breakfast, snack or dessert. Most fruits are sweet and ready for you to eat without cooking or preparing a recipe. Take an apple, a peach, or a <br>banana and just enjoy. Remember to always have fresh fruit available at home. If you have good choices available, you will make good choices.</li>
                <br>
                <li>Children are now eating highly processed snacks that are nutritionally poor and a threat to their future health.  These products are loaded with artificial colors, flavors, <br>refined sugars and are super high in calories. Kids are eating more refined sugars than ever before. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention’s statistics are alarming. By 2050, 1 in 3 people will have diabetes.

            <p>What is momo?</p>

            <p> A momo is made from thin flour pastry with a filling inside. It’s essentially a little dumpling.</p>

            <p>Momos are found in Nepal and Tibet. There are many other variations around the world though from India and China all the way to Europe. But in Nepal the momo does have some unique attributes and variations worth mentioning.</p>
            <p> The best place to find momos in Nepal is where ever they are freshly cooking them. The worst place is some side cafe that has them sitting there all day in a low-grade electric steamer.</p>

                <p>Pasta first became popular in Naples in the 1700s where it was combined with tomato sauce. It was an ideal food to feed large parts of the population. When more and more Italians immigrated to America at the beginning of the 20 th century they took their eating habits with them. Pasta and pizza immediately became widespread and popular in America.</p>
                <p>Feeling stuck or intimidated by that essay needed for your college application? That stops now. </p>

                <p>Let’s keep it simple. Consider, for a moment, a really good plate of pasta—three or four ingredients cooked in a noble, pure and unaffected way. Is there anything more satisfying, more genuine? That’s what you want in your college essay. A simple, pure, genuine plate of honest goodness. </p>
            
                <p>The Pasta: This is your story. Fresh or dried, it doesn’t matter as long as it’s a quality story, a great little slice-of-life story that speaks volumes as to who you are, what you want, and where you’re going. </p>
